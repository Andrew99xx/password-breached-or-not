# Password-Breached-or-Not Android Application

This Android application lets users check if their password has been breached using the "Xposed Or Not" API.

## Project Overview

The application takes in a password as input, generates a Keccak 512 hash of the password, and sends the first 10 characters of the hash to the "Xposed Or Not" API. The API checks if the hash is present in its database of breached passwords. If the hash is found in the database, it implies that the password has been breached.

## Key Components

1. **Keccak512Hasher.java:** A class that provides a method to generate a Keccak 512 hash of a given string.

2. **MainActivity.java:** The main activity of the Android app, which sends a GET request to the "Xposed Or Not" API and processes the response to determine if the entered password has been breached.

## How to Use

1. Open the application and enter your password.
2. Press the "Check" button.
3. The application will alert you if your password has been breached.

## Dependencies

- [Volley](https://developer.android.com/training/volley): This library is used to send HTTP requests to the "Xposed Or Not" API.
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson): This library is used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation and vice versa.
- [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/): This library is used for its implementation of the Keccak 512 hash function.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more robust error handling and user input validation.
- Implement a more secure way to handle and store user passwords.
- Improve UI/UX to make the app more user-friendly.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this application should only be used for educational purposes. It should not be used as a definitive measure of a password's security. It is always recommended to use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible.
